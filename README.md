**SIAMESE** - Simulation of Assembly and Manufacturing Lines

*- yeah, silly acronym, I know...*

## Instalation

- `pip install siamese-optimizer`

## Documentation

- [Getting started](examples/Getting%20Started.ipynb)
- [Examples folder](examples)
- Docstrings are available in every main object.

## What can this package do now?

- Build a manufacturing line using machines and buffers instances;
- Simulate the line with Simpy;
- Generate plot and reports of results;
- Draw the line with NetworkX.

## What will this do in the future?

- Otimizations and suggestions, such as changing buffer capacity or machine speed.

## What are the next steps?

- Create an official `Sink` object;
- Finish `CountFailure` object;
- Create objects the combine and duplicate entities.


## Could you please explain the underlying theory?

- Sure, but I'm kinda busy right now. I'll do it in a probably-near future.
